# Learning Management System (LMS)

## Project Overview

This Learning Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive educational platform designed to facilitate online learning. It consists of two main components:

1. A web-based interface for students to access courses and track their progress.
2. A Java Swing desktop application for administrators to manage the system.

## Web Interface

The web interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and intuitive user experience for students.

### Features

- User authentication (login system)
- Dashboard displaying enrolled courses and progress
- Course catalog with available courses
- Progress tracking for each enrolled course
- Discussion forums for student interaction

### File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure for the LMS web interface
- `styles.css`: CSS styles for the web interface
- `script.js`: JavaScript for handling user interactions and dynamic content
- `main.js`: Additional JavaScript file for login and dashboard functionality

### Setup and Running

1. Ensure you have a web server set up (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
2. Place all web files in your server's root directory
3. Access the LMS through your web browser by navigating to the server's address

## Java Swing Application

The Java Swing application serves as an administrative tool for managing the LMS.

### Features

- User authentication for administrators
- Dashboard for system overview
- Course management (add, edit, delete courses)
- Student progress tracking
- Forum moderation tools

### File Structure

- `MainFrame.java`: Main application window and entry point
- `LoginPanel.java`: Login interface for administrators
- `DashboardPanel.java`: Main dashboard displaying system information and navigation

### Setup and Running

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
2. Compile the Java files:



## Development

### Web Interface

The web interface uses modern HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript. It's designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

To modify the web interface:
1. Edit `index.html` for structural changes
2. Modify `styles.css` for styling updates
3. Update `script.js` and `main.js` for new functionalities or behavior changes

### Java Swing Application

The Java application is built using Swing for the graphical user interface. It follows an object-oriented design with separate classes for different panels and functionalities.

To modify the Java application:
1. Edit the respective `.java` files for each component
2. Recompile the project after making changes
3. Test thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a backend API to connect the web interface with a database
- Add more interactive elements to the courses, such as quizzes and assignments
- Integrate video conferencing for live classes
- Develop a mobile app version of the LMS
